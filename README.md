## GUIDE FOR PYTHON SCRIPTS

### FOR ALL FOUR CODE FILES: KEY DATA FILES INCLUDE: 
#### 1) RAW DATA FILES - ALL DATAFRAMES; 
  FIELDS (LOCATIONS AND PROPERTIES), 
  REFINERIES (LOCATIONS, CONSUMPTION SLATES), 
  PIPELINES (LOCATIONS AND ATTRIBUTES),
  TERMINALS (LOCATIONS),
  FUTURE ENERGY SCENARIOS
#### 2) NETWORK PICKLE OBJECT (CONTAINS NODES AND EDGES OF FIELDS, PIPELINES, REFINERIES, TERMINALS) BASED ON RAW DATA


#### E.G. IN THE BLEND ESTIMATION ALGORITHM SCRIPT

```
aramfl_new_new = ## DATAFRAME OF FIELDS - LOCATIONS, NAMES, COUNTRIES, VOLUMES, API
...
ar_ref = ## DATAFRAME OF REFINERY COORDINATES

```
